Jules has previously contributed to undergraduate and/or graduate courses on the following topics:

* European Cinema (Comparative Studies)

* The Body (Comparative Studies)

* Introduction to French Literature, Linguistics, Film and Thought

* Translation from French to English

* Moving Image outside the Cinema (Master's)

In 2018, he helped to set up a popular **Critical Theory** seminar at Cambridge which caters to over sixty Modern Languages students from across all year groups. This course exposes students to a variety of schools of thought and critical paradigms to explore questions of power, class, gender, race, geopolitics, embodiment, thought, aesthetics, textuality, and authorship. Going against the grain of 'canonical' approaches to the study of literary and cultural criticism, which tend to sediment knowledge, this class offers a thoughtful and substantive integration of minority voices into its curriculum.

Since 2020, Jules has run his own graduate module titled **Spaces of Queer Cinema** for MPhil students in Film and Screen Studies, and European Literatures and Cultures. This course offers an introduction to global queer cinema through the analytic prism of spatiality, and core readings are drawn from a range of fields including film and media studies, queer theory, and spatial thought. For an indication of this courseâ€™s scope, you can find a module outline [here](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/fss-queer).
