In the 2024/2025 academic year, Jules convenes [Cinema and the Political](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/cs7) (a final year undergraduate course on political cinema), [Gender, Sexuality, and Space](https://www.film.cam.ac.uk/mphil/modules/) (an MPhil unit in film studies), and co-teaches [Theorising Moving Images](https://www.film.cam.ac.uk/mphil/core/) (the Core Course for the MPhil in Film and Screen studies) with Dr Kareem Estefan.
In recent years, Jules has also contributed to undergraduate and/or graduate courses on the following topics:
* Introduction to European Cinema (Comparative Studies)
* Introduction to French Literature, Linguistics, Film and Thought
* Translation from French to English
* The Body (Comparative Studies)
* Ethics and Experience: Literature, Thought, and Visual Culture of the French-speaking world
* Moving Image outside the Cinema (Master’s)

In 2018, he helped to set up a popular **Critical Theory** seminar at Cambridge which caters to over sixty Modern Languages students from across all year groups. This course exposes students to a variety of schools of thought and critical paradigms to explore questions of power, class, gender, race, geopolitics, embodiment, thought, aesthetics, textuality, and authorship. Going against the grain of ‘canonical’ approaches to the study of literary and cultural criticism, which tend to sediment knowledge, this class offers a thoughtful and substantive integration of minority voices into its curriculum.

From 2020-2022, Jules also set up a graduate module called **Spaces of Queer Cinema** for MPhil students in Film and Screen Studies, and European Literatures and Cultures. This course offers an introduction to global queer cinema through the analytic prism of spatiality, and core readings are drawn from a range of fields including film and media studies, queer theory, and spatial thought. For an indication of this course’s scope, you can find a module outline [here](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/fss-queer).
