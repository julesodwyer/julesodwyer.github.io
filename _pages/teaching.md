Jules has previously contributed to undergraduate and/or graduate courses on the following topics:
* European Cinema (Comparative Studies)
* The Body (Comparative Studies)
* Introduction to French Literature, Linguistics, Film and Thought
* Translation from French to English
* Moving Image outside the Cinema (Master's)


In 2018, he set up a popular **Critical Theory** seminar in Cambridge, catering to over sixty students across all year groups. Calling into question previous approaches to the teaching of “canonical” literary and cultural criticism, this course aimed for gender parity in terms of assigned readings, as well as a thoughtful and substantive integration of minority voices into the core curriculum.

Since 2020, Jules has run his own optional graduate unit titled **Spaces of Queer Cinema** for students in Film and Screen Studies, and European Literatures and Cultures. For an indication of this course’s scope, here is an extract from the module outline:

From early accounts of cinema that privileged the medium’s affinities with architecture to contemporary work on the geopolitics of film’s circulation and exhibition, the question of space has been a central concern in film theory. Cinematic space, however, is a slippery concept with no commonly agreed upon definition. More than a straightforward synonym for a film’s setting or geographic referent, scholars are increasingly using the term cinematic space to describe the complex relations between the profilmic image and off-screen space, between cinematic landscape and soundscape, between narrative space and the sites of cinema’s reception (—including both the architecture of the film theatre and the bodies that populate it). The aim of this course is to think through the multiple facets cinematic space as a way of offering a more expansive account of queer cinema. Looking beyond a representational paradigm focused on the onscreen politics of sexual identity, we will turn our attention to broader themes of embodiment, space and materiality. In this module we will consider a range of questions, including: How have histories of censorship delimited the field of vision? (And how have queer spectators negotiated their relation to these image economies?); How do queer filmmakers articulate questions of privacy, publicity, sexual visibility and disclosure in formal terms?; And how might a spatial approach to queer cinema yield new insights into a range of topics, from subcultural sexual practices to processes of urban gentrification, and from the rural/urban fault line in queer representation to the politics of sexuality in an uneven global frame? In this module, students will engage with a broad spectrum of cinematic objects—from America and France to Sweden and Taiwan—and readings will be drawn from a range of fields including film studies, queer theory and spatial thought.
