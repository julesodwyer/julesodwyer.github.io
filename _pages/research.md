[Cinema and the Political](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/cs7)

Spatiality has long been a crucial and potent lens for understanding French culture and aesthetics. While canonical filmmakers like Jean-Luc Godard, Agnès Varda, and Louis Malle invoked the notion of flânerie to explore ideas of modernism, spatial exploration, and urban sociality, this book demonstrates how a more recent generation of French queer filmmakers continue to engage with—and contest-this spatial legacy by focusing their attention on the cognate practice of cruising.
Through the work of Jacques Nolot, Sébastien Lifshitz, Christophe Honoré, Vincent Dieutre, Alain Guiraudie, and others, _The Seduction of Space_ draws film theory, queer studies, and spatial inquiry into close proximity to examine the politics of cruising and the gendering of space. Making the case that cinema not only documents the queer spaces of the past but continues to produce them, the book maps the relationships between sex and spatiality by taking up such varied topics as public sex in the porn theater, racial eroticization in the banlieue, the ecocritical valences of rural cruising, and the geopolitics of sexuality in an expanded Francophone frame. Foregrounding the crucial role that spatiality plays in shaping the parameters of France’s visual cultures and political imaginary, this study represents both an urgent queer reconceptualization of this tradition and a clarion call for film scholars to tarry with the politics of sexuality in all its messiness. An exercise in reading queer cinematic space, _The Seduction of Space_ makes conceptual interventions that resonate far beyond the book’s immediate national context.

### Praise:

"_The Seduction of Space_ is brilliantly conceived and fills a clear gap in the field of queer French film studies, namely the priority of sexuality and its links to questions of space and spatiality, relationality, and queer visual cultures more broadly. Stylishly and intelligently written, energetically argued, and eminently readable, this is sophisticated critical work of the highest order and an invaluable contribution to queer film theory and queer critical studies." — David A. Gerstner, City University of New York

"Recalling and twisting to perverse effect the title of Henri Lefebvre’s landmark work on the production of space, Jules O’Dwyer’s magnificent _The Seduction of Space_ explores the role of queer sexual desire in the production of spatial relations. O’Dwyer engages intimately with French queer film culture to produce a pioneering book that interweaves French cinema, film theory, queer studies, and spatial thought." — Sarah Cooper, King's College London

From the Chateau Marmont to Marienbad, and from the Bates Motel to the Overlook Hotel, the hotels we encounter in the cinema often serve as much more than the mute backdrop against which a film’s action transpires. Rather, hotel spaces actively scaffold the formal, aesthetic, and narrative possibilities of cinema. My current book project considers the parallels between cinema and the hotel--two ‘hyperaesthetic’ spaces that appeal to experiential logics of fantasy, immersion, and aspiration; spaces that mediate our encounters with cultural difference and the world outside. This book reads the hotel as a privileged site for exploring the dynamics and contradictions that structure the modern condition: they are simultaneously public and private, spaces of leisure and labor. Hotel spaces mediate the spatiotemporal registers of the local and the global, historicity and anachronism. _Hotels_ grounds readings of individual films within broader histories of moving image media. Drawing on a purposefully broad array of cinematic texts—from work by Lila Avilés to Liliana Cavani, and from Andy Warhol to Apichatpong Weerasethakul—I consider both how and why the institution of the hotel holds such a strong purchase on the cinematic imaginary.

### Praise:

“_Hotels_ ingeniously charts the trajectories of sight and site in the cinematic hotel, that place where the illicit transpires and fantasies are projected. From early silent shorts to the Chelsea Hotel, from Claire Denis to Atom Egoyan to Chantal Akerman, O’Dwyer shows how films and hotels have mutually constituted one another across a shared history. This slim volume offers a new way to imagine both cinema and its spaces.” - B. Ruby Rich, author of _New Queer Cinema: The Director’s Cut_
